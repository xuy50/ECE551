As you bask in the morning light pouring through the bakery windows,
your breath is taken away by the stunning display of pastries in the case.

"What would you like?" The shop keeper ask cheerily.  Realizing you
have a long journey ahead of you, you decide it is best to order
one, but choosing is so hard.

What would you like to do?

 1. Purchase a chocolate croissant.
 2. Purchase an eclair.
 3. Purchase a muffin.

and hands it to you.  He wishes you a good day.

As you leave the store, something feels...strange about the morning.
You aren't quite sure what, but you sense that something unusual
and strange is about to happen.  The street in front of you runs
east, out of town, or west deeper into town.  

What would you like to do?

 1. Go east, out of town
 2. Go west, into town

As you head out of town, you notice a shadow pass over you as
something large flies over your head.

What would you like to do?

 2. Keep walking

==========
As you wander through town, you notice the blacksmith working on a
shiny, glowing sword.  He looks up from his work and says
"You look like the sort of hero who might need a sword?
Strange things in the air, can't go wrong with a sword.."
Checking your pockets, you find a few coins left after
your pastry purchase, but you would be broke if your
spent your money on the sword.

What would you like to do?

 1. Buy the sword
 2. Decline and head out of town
Page 7
==========
You purchase a gleaming shiny sword, and head out of town.
Surely this will keep you safe, no matter what you run into....right?

What would you like to do?

 1. Now that you have a sword, head out of town

==========
Good thing you jumped behind a rock!  A large dragon swooped
down and landed on the road right where you just were.
The dragon looks hungry and ferocious...

What would you like to do?

 1. Ask the dragon if he has heard any good jokes lately.
Page 9
==========
Unfortunately the shadow flying overhead was a large
hungry dragon, who swooped down and ate you for breakfast.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
Page 10
==========
You offer the last of your money to the dragon, who seems a bit surprised.
"Oh thank you!" he says.  Now, I can just go buy some breafkast
at the bakery rather than eating travelers who wander on the roadways.

And everyone lived happily ever after.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!

As you charge the dragon with your sword, you realize
that you don't really have training in sword fighting.
The dragon happily eats you for breakfast.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

==========
"Oh thank you this looks delicious!" the dragon says
as he devours the pastry.   "I was so hungry I couldn't
think straight and was about to eat you!  How terrible
would that have been."

Having solved the dragon's hunger problems, he is happy
to give you a ride back to your house.  Everyone lives
happily ever after.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!

You squirt the eclair filling right in the dragon's eyes!
The dragon can't see anything, but now you need
to quickly decide how to best take advantage of this situation.

What would you like to do?

==========
As you throw the muffin at the dragon, it harmlessly bounces off
his thick scales.  You wonder what you were thinking as the dragon
eats you for breakfast.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

"Oh my! I'm so hungry, but I do love a good joke.   The
best one I've heard lately is
  Why can't you hear a pterodactyl go to the bathroom?"

The dragon asks waiting a moment for you to reply.
"...because the P is silent?"  you guess.

"HAHAH YES!  I love that one.  Tell you what,
if you tell me a great joke in return, I'll go find
someone else to eat..."

What would you like to do?

 1. What 80s band would sing "You have to fight for your right to lg(N) search?"
 2. What do you call it when you see the same ghost twice?
 3. Knock knock.
Page 16
==========
As you fling the coins at the dragon, the jangling sound they make in
the air lets the dragon know where you are.  He turns and breathes
fire at you.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
Page 17
==========
Even though you don't really know how to use a sword,
the dragon is blinded by your eclair filling.  You
defeat the dragon.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
Page 18
==========
You start to run, but the remaining coins in your pocket
jangle loudly.  The dragon hears you and breathes fire
at you.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
Page 19
==========
You run away.  Not the most heroic victory,
but we'll call it a win.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
Page 20
==========
The dragon thinks for a moment then asks your
"Ok, what 80s band would sing 'You have to fight
for your right to lg(N) search?"

"The BST-boys!" you exclaim proudly.

Sadly, the dragon does not know about binary search trees,
80s bands, or Big-O, and does not find your joke funny,
so eats you.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

==========
The dragon ponders for a second then exclaims
"Deja boo! HAHAHAHA Ok, that was pretty good.
I'll find someone else to eat."

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!

"Who is there?" asks the dragon.

"Mansplain" you reply

"Mansplain who?" The dragon asks.

"Well actually, you see mansplaining is about some particular topic.
So the right question for you to ask is 'Mansplain what?'..."

"Haha, ok you can go." The dragon says as he flies off.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
